# CodeAlpha_Basic_Chatbot
This project involves creating a text-based chatbot capable of engaging in conversations with users. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) , the chatbot can process and interpret the text allowing it to handle a wide range of topics and provide meaningful responses.
